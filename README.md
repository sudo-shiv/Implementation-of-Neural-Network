# Implementation-of-Neural-Network
Implementation of Neural Network of ANN, CNN and RNN.

# Neural Networks from Scratch

This repository contains "from-scratch" implementations of three fundamental neural network architectures using Python and NumPy. These implementations avoid high-level deep learning frameworks to demonstrate the underlying mathematics of backpropagation and gradient descent.

## 🚀 Architectures Included

### 1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

### 3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
